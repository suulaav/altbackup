# altbackup
simple pet project that helps me backup my photos and videos to a hard-disk hooked up to a raspberry pie ,from google photos and clean google photos so i do not exceed 15gb of storage limit.

## This project will do two things
1. Backup and clear all photos and videos in google photos account.
2. Serve backed up images to me via a dedicated portal.
